Overview
--------
``Pyret`` is a Python package that provides tools for analyzing stimulus-evoked
neurophysiology data. The project grew out of work in a retinal neurophsyiology
and computation lab (hence the name), but its functionality should be applicable
to any neuroscience work in which you wish to characterize how neurons behave
in response to an input.

``Pyret``'s functionality is broken into modules.

- ``stimulustools``: Functions for manipulating input stimuli.
- ``spiketools``: Tools to characterize spikes.
- ``filtertools``: Tools to estimate and characterize linear filters fitted to neural data.
- ``nonlinearities``: Classes for estimating static nonlinearities.
- ``visualizations``: Functions to visualize responses and fitted filters/nonlinearities.

``Pyret`` works on Python3.4+ and Python2.7.

Importing ``pyret``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's explore how ``pyret`` might be used in a very common analysis pipeline. First, we'll
import the relevant modules.

    >>> import pyret
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

For this demo, we'll be using data from a retinal ganglion cell (RGC), whose spike times were
recorded using a multi-electrode array. (Data courtesy of Lane McIntosh.) We'll load the 
stimulus used in the experiment, as well as the spike times for the cell.

The data is stored in the GitHub repository, in both HDF5 and NumPy's native ``.npz`` formats.
The following code snippets show how to download and load the data in those formats,
respectively. Note that using data in the HDF5 format imposes the additional dependency of
the ``h5py`` package, which is available on PyPI.

Loading data from HDF5
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To download the data in HDF5 format, use the shell command:

.. code:: bash

    $ wget https://github.com/baccuslab/pyret/raw/master/docs/tutorial-data.h5

To use ``curl`` instead of ``wget``, run:

.. code:: bash

    $ curl -L -o tutorial-data.h5 https://github.com/baccuslab/pyret/raw/master/docs/tutorial-data.h5

To load the data, back in the Python shell, run:

    >>> data_file = h5py.File('tutorial-data.h5', 'r')
    >>> spikes = data_file['spike-times']  # Spike times for one cell
    >>> stimulus = data_file['stimulus'].value.astype(np.float64)
    >>> frame_rate = data_file['stimulus'].attrs.get('frame-rate')

Loading data from ``.npz``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To download and the data in the ``.npz`` file format, use the following command:

.. code:: bash

    $ wget https://github.com/baccuslab/pyret/raw/master/docs/tutorial-data.npz

Or, using ``curl``:

.. code:: bash

    $ curl -L -o tutorial-data.npz https://github.com/baccuslab/pyret/raw/master/docs/tutorial-data.npz

Then, in the Python shell, load the data with:

    >>> arrays = np.load('tutorial-data.npz')
    >>> spikes, stimulus, frame_rate = arrays['spikes'], arrays['stimulus'].astype(np.float64), arrays['frame_rate'][0]

Estimating firing rates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The stimulus is a spatio-temporal gaussian white noise checkboard, with shape ``(time, nx, ny)``.
Each spatial position is drawn independently from a normal distribution on each
temporal frame. We will z-score the stimulus, and create a time-axis for it, to reference
the spike times for this cell to the frames of the stimulus.

    >>> stimulus -= stimulus.mean()
    >>> stimulus /= stimulus.std()
    >>> time = np.arange(stimulus.shape[0]) * frame_rate

To begin, let's look at the spiking behavior of the RGC. We'll create a peri-stimulus
time histogram, by binning the spike times and smoothing a bit. This is an estimate of the
firing rate of the RGC over time.

    >>> binned = pyret.spiketools.binspikes(spikes, time)
    >>> rate = pyret.spiketools.estfr(binned, time)
    >>> plt.plot(time[:500], rate[:500])
    >>> plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
    >>> plt.ylabel('Firing rate (Hz)')

Estimating a receptive field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One widely-used and informative description of the cell is its receptive field. This
is a linear approximation to the function of the cell, and captures the average visual
feature to which it responds. Because our data consists of spike times, we'll compute
the *spike-triggered average* (STA) for the cell. 
    
    >>> filter_length_seconds = 0.5  # 500 ms filter
    >>> filter_length = int(filter_length_seconds / frame_rate)
    >>> sta, tax = pyret.filtertools.sta(time, stimulus, spikes, filter_length)
    >>> fig, axes = pyret.visualizations.plot_sta(tax, sta)
    >>> axes[0].set_title('Recovered spatial filter (STA)')
    >>> axes[1].set_title('Recovered temporal filter (STA)')
    >>> axes[1].set_xlabel('Time relative to spike (s)')
    >>> axes[1].set_ylabel('Filter response')

.. IMPORTANT::
    It is common to hear the terms "STA", "linear filter", and "receptive field"
    used interchangeably. However, this is technically incorrect. The STA is an
    unbiased estimate of the time-reverse of a best-fitting linear filter (in
    the least-squares sense), *assuming the stimulus is uncorrelated*. If the
    stimulus contains correlations, those will appear in the arrays returned by
    both ``filtertools.sta`` and ``filtertools.revcorr``. As Gaussian white
    noise, which is uncorrelated, is an exceedingly common stimulus, practioners
    often loosely refer to the STA as the linear filter, keeping the time-reversing 
    process implicit. The ``pyret`` methods and docstrings strive for the maximal
    amount of clarity when refering to these objects, and the documentation should
    be heeded about whether a filter or STA is expected.

Estimating a nonlinearity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While the STA gives a lot of information, it is not the whole story. Real RGCs are definitely
*not* linear. One common way to correct for this fact is to fit a single, time-invariant
(static), point-wise nonlinearity to the data. This is a mapping between the linear response
to the real spiking data; in other words, it captures the difference between how the cell
*would response if it were linear* and how the cell actually responds.

The first step in computing a nonlinearity is to compute how the recovered linear
filter responds to the input stimulus. This is done via convolution of the linear filter
with the stimulus.

    >>> pred = pyret.filtertools.linear_response(sta[::-1], stimulus)
    >>> stimulus.shape
    (30011, 20, 20)
    >>> pred.shape
    (30011,)

.. IMPORTANT::
    Note here that we're *flipping* the STA before passing it to the
    ``linear_response`` function. This function expects a true *linear filter*,
    while the arrays returned by ``sta`` and ``revcorr`` are reverse-
    correlations. This must be flipped along the time (zero-th) axis
    to arrive at a filter.

We can get a sense for how poor our linear prediction is, simply by plotting the
predicted versus the actual response at each time point.

    >>> plt.plot(pred, rate, linestyle='none', marker='o', mew=1, mec='w')
    >>> plt.xlabel('Linearly predicted output')
    >>> plt.ylabel('True output (Hz)')

    :width: 500px
    :alt: Predicted vs true firing rates for one RGC

It's clear that there is at least some nonlinear behavior in the cell. For one thing,
firing rates can never be negative, but our linear prediction definitely is.

``pyret`` contains several classes for fitting nonlinearities to data. The simplest is
the ``Binterp`` class (a portmanteau of "bin" and "interpolate"), which computes the
average true output in specified bins along the input axis. It uses variable-sized
bins, so that each bin has roughly the same number of data points. 
    
    >>> nbins = 50
    >>> binterp = pyret.nonlinearities.Binterp(nbins)
    >>> binterp.fit(pred, rate)
    >>> nonlin_range = (pred.min(), pred.max())
    >>> binterp.plot(nonlin_range, linewidth=5, label='Binterp')  # Plot nonlinearity over the given range

One can also fit sigmoidal nonlinearities, or a nonlinearity using a Gaussian process
(which has some nice advantages, and returns errorbars automatically). More information 
about these can be found in the full documentation.

We can now compare how well the full LN model captures the cell's response characteristics.

    >>> predicted_rate = binterp.predict(pred)
    >>> plt.figure()
    >>> plt.plot(time[:500], rate[:500], linewidth=5, color=(0.75,) * 3, alpha=0.7, label='True rate')
    >>> plt.plot(time[:500], predicted_rate[:500], linewidth=2, color=(0.75, 0.1, 0.1), label='LN predicted rate')
    >>> plt.legend()
    >>> plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
    >>> plt.ylabel('Firing rate (Hz)')
    >>> np.corrcoef(rate, predicted_rate)[0, 1] # Correlation coefficient on training data
