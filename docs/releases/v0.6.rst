=============
v0.6 (Active)
=============

New features
------------
- Adds the ability to extend temporal filters to be acausal (past the time of the spike)
- Adds an ``RBF`` class for estimating a nonlinearity using tiled radial basis functions.

API changes
-----------
- Removes outdated ``stimulustools.rolling_window`` method.
- In fixing a bug in ``linear_response``, then method now returns an array of the
  same shape as the stimulus input, rather than one shorter by the length of the
  filter whose response is computed.

Bug fixes
----------
- Fixes a bug in the ``Sigmoid`` nonlinearity due do shuffled dictionary keys
- Fixes bug in ``linear_response``, which was supposed to take a filter, but actually
  took a reverse-correlation.
- Fixes incorrect documentation for ``stimulustools.slicestim``.
